## Problem Statement:

Old Age homes are very difficult place to live in. Lots of people donâ€™t have a family that can support them and lots of residents are crushed by mobility problems. These People have sacrificed a lot in thier whole lifetime to support thier families. Now when they need support from their family, they have to face this harsh reality. We Devengers wanted to do something for them. 

**StayConnected** is a Virtual Chatbot. It trains over few images of the loved ones and creats a virtual Avatar which resembles them. No one can replace family, But being able to talk to someone who looks like them and talks like them will definately ease some pain.
